# Scattering direction - Spherical coodinates - Azimuthal angle phi
# The azimuthal angle phi is the clockwise angle [0,2pi], in the [x_{L}y_{L}]-plane,
# between the scattering plane and the +x_{L}-axis looking in the +z_{L}-axis direction
# i.e. the angle between the scattering plane and the xz-plane. The scattering plane is
# the plane containing the incident direction and the scattering direction [+z_{L}-axis
# & n_{sca}]), phi=0 => scattering plane=xz-plane, phi=90 => scattering plane=yz-plane
# Notes: (1) Must be positive and monotonically increasing
