# Scattering direction - Spherical coodinates - Polar/zenith angle theta
# The polar/zenith angle theta is the angle [0,pi], in the scattering plane,
# between the incident direction +z_{L}-axis and the scattering direction n_{sca}
# theta=0 => forward scattering, scattering direction=+z_{L} axis
# theta=180 => backward scattering, scattering direction=-z_{L} axis
# Notes: (1) Must be positive and monotonically increasing
